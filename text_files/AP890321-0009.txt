Legislative leaders turned thumbs down Monday on a
proposal to pay impeached Gov. Evan Mecham for costs he incurred
preparing for a recall election that was never held.
   Mecham said he would now take his fight to the state Supreme
Court.
   ``I've been trying to do this the peaceful way,'' he said. ``I
guess there's no healing to be done; we have to fight about
everything.''
   Arizona law provides for reimbursement in recall elections, but
Mecham was impeached by the state House of Representatives and
convicted in the state Senate last year before a scheduled recall
election could be held.
   The state Supreme Court cancelled the election after Mecham's
ouster elevated Secretary of State Rose Mofford to the governorship,
but Mecham asked for $269,325 to reimburse him for expenses incurred
before the ouster.
   The House rejected the request last year, but Mecham lobbied
legislative leaders to reconsider the matter this session.
   ``We had our attorneys look at it,'' said John Mawhinney, the
Senate's majority leader. ``This is not a vindictive thing.''
   The lawyers found no instance in any state where an officeholder
was paid expenses for an election that did not occur, Mawhinney said.
   Based on that, House Speaker Jane Hull and Senate President
Robert Usdane concluded that ``there being no recall election, there
is no obligation for the state to pay,'' Mawhinney said.
   Mecham was impeached and ousted last year for misuse of funds and
obstruction of justice.
