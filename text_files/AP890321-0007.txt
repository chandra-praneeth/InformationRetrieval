Iranian lawmakers demanded a review of
relations with Turkey after a Turkish court prohibited college women
from covering their heads in the Islamic tradition, Tehran radio
reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said a letter signed by 150
Parliament deputies urged the Iranian government ``to adjust
cultural, political and economic ties with Turkey, according to its
treatment of Islam and Moslems.''
   Dozens of Moslem fundamentalists were arrested in Turkey on
Friday following demonstrations in several cities against the
court-imposed ban on Islamic head scarves.
   Turkey's constitutional court last week ruled unconstitutional a
December decision by Turkey's Parliament that women university
students could wear the head scarves.
   Opponents of Parliament's decision consider the scarves symbols
of Moslem fundamentalism and a threat to the secularism guaranteed
in the constitution.
   Iran, which is governed by strict Islamic law, has harshly
criticized the ruling and Turkish foreign ministry officials have in
turn attacked Tehran for becoming involved in the matter.
   The neighbors maintain otherwise friendly relations and are
grouped in a three-member Economic Cooperation Organization together
with Pakistan.
